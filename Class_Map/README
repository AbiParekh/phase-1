Project 1 - MapReduce Team Project 

Map Class: 
The map class will contain a public method map(), that accepts a key and value.
The key will be the file nameand the value will be a single line of raw data from
the file.
The map() function tokenizes the value into distinct words scanning for alphanumeric
characters only replacing capitalized characters with lower case. 

DISCLAIMER: Non alphanumeric characters such as punctuation, white space, hyphons ("-") 
and apostrophes ("'") will be removed. This may modify the meaning of a given token.

The map() function will calls a separate export function that takes a key and value as 
two parameters. The export function will buffer output in memoryand periodically write 
the data out to disk. periodicity based on the size of the buffer which can be specified 
via argument when constructing map(). The intermediate data will be written to user specified
temporary directory passed as argument when constructing map()
